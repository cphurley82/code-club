## Lesson: Loops

1. What is a loop?
    * A loop is a way to repeat a block of code.
    * Computers are fast, so we can repeat a block of code as many times as we want.
    * Most things we do with computers are done in loops.
2. Types of loops in Scratch:
    * [Repeat () block](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Repeat_()_(block)){:target="_blank"} for counting.
    * [Forever block](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Forever_(block)){:target="_blank"} never stops never stoping.
    * [Repeat Unitl () block](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Repeat_Until_()_(block)){:target="_blank"} for when you want to repeat until a condition is met.

## Activity: Catch the bus

1. Optional: Find a partner for pair programming.
2. Follow the directions to complete your own [Catch the bus](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus/0){:target="_blank"} project.
    * [https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus/0](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus/0){:target="_blank"}
3. Post your version of Catch the Bus to the class studio: "Catch the bus".
