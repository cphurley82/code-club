## Lesson

1. What is Artificial Intelligence?
    * Artificial intelligence is when computers can do things that usually need
      human intelligence to get done, like understanding language, recognizing
      faces, or solving problems.
2. What is Machine Learning?
    * Machine learning is when computers can learn and improve by themselves
      *without being explicitly programmed*, by using data and algorithms to
      find patterns and make decisions.
3. Demo:
    * [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com).
    * [Dall-E](https://labs.openai.com/).
    * [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).
