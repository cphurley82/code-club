**The Creative Code Club for Games and Art** is a place were students ages
9 to 14 can learn to code and have fun creating code on computers.

Each week will have a new post which includes a lesson, activity, and
additional resources that may be helpful. The lessons are intended to be viewed
in person but I include related videos in case you missed the in-person lesson.
